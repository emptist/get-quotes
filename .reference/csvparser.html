CSV parser using javascript

The following is javascript code which is used to read CSV file. I wrote the code starting from opening CSV file, loading to memory, parsing (into lines and then into fields), and finally displaying as a table.

You can modify it whatever you like. But remember, don’t forget to put my credit :)

<form>

<input type="file" name="F1" id="F1" size="80">

<input type="button" value="Read" name="B1" id="B1" onclick="execFile()">
 <input type="reset" value="Reset" name="B2" id="B2" onclick="renderArea.innerHTML=''">

<div id="renderArea"></div>

var renderArea=document.getElementById("renderArea");

 progressWindow.document.write("<html><head></head><body>

 var progressArea = progressWindow.document.getElementById("progressArea");

Nice script. It savved me some time on creating one myself.

I’ve modified parseLineCSV() because parsing did not happen as expected for lines like :
“nom, surmane and name, surname”, “514-514-5145″, “Montreal, Canada”

Here is the modification :

function parseLineCSV(lineCSV) {
// parse csv line by line into array
var CSV = new Array();

// Insert space before character “,”. This is to anticipate ‘split’ in IE
// try this:
//
// var a=”,,,a,,b,,c,,,,d”;
// a=a.split(/\,/g);
// document.write(a.length);
//
// You will see unexpected result!
//
lineCSV = lineCSV.replace(/,/g,” , “);

lineCSV = lineCSV.split(/,/g);

// This is continuing of ‘split’ issue in IE
// remove all trailing space in each field
for (var i=0;i<lineCSV.length;i++) {
lineCSV[i] = lineCSV[i].replace(/\s*$/g,””);
}

lineCSV[lineCSV.length-1]=lineCSV[lineCSV.length-1].replace(/^\s*|\s*$/g,””);

var fstart = -1;
//MODIFICATION START
var quotedStr = false;
var endQuotedStr = false;

for (var i=0;i<lineCSV.length;i++) {
//if we start a quoted string
if(!quotedStr && lineCSV[i].match(/^\s*”/))
{
quotedStr = true;
fstart = i;
}
//if we are going out of a quoted string
if(quotedStr && lineCSV[i].match(/”\s*$/))
{
endQuotedStr = true;
}
//if this piece of string is inside the quoted string and it is not the first part
// do concatenation
if (quotedStr && fstart < i){
lineCSV[fstart]=lineCSV[fstart]+”,”+lineCSV[i];
lineCSV[i]=”-DELETED-“;
}
//we are out of this quoted string, resets default values
if(endQuotedStr)
{
quotedStr = false;
endQuotedStr = false;
fstart = -1;
}
}
//MODIFICATION END

var j=0;
for (var i=0;i<lineCSV.length;i++) {
if (lineCSV[i]!=”-DELETED-“) {
CSV[j] = lineCSV[i];
CSV[j] = CSV[j].replace(/^\s*|\s*$/g,””); // remove leading & trailing space
CSV[j] = CSV[j].replace(/^”|”$/g,””); // remove ” on the beginning and end
CSV[j] = CSV[j].replace(/””/g,'”‘); // replace “” with ”
j++;
}
}

return CSV;
}

Hi,

I tried your script. It doesn’t work on IE as well as Mozilla.
Could you please have a look and let me know the changes required?

thanks

Could you tell me what error that you received (both IE and Mozilla)?

I suppose Girish was getting error due to bad characters like the single and double quotes.
I got this one and substituted them inside the code.
I mean ” with ” and ’ with ‘.

After this change it works perfectly in both IE and Mozilla.

Ok, sorry, posting my comment the single and double quotes are “transleted”, so they don’t appear as they are written by me.

Btw, I think the issue is clear. Substituting the quotes the code works properly.

makes the access denied error due to security. It either needs a cross-domain policy or just run the csv in the same domain.

Hi, nice code but it doesn’t work to me. I always get 404 error – there is no file entered to file input field.
instead of:
var arr = readCSV(myfile.value);
I have written:
var arr = myfile.files.item(0).getAsBinary();
Don’t need Ajax etc.

Hi,

Thank you for taking the time and care to post your javascript solution on the web! When I use the code with Firefox, nothing happens, with IE8 I get a string of errors. I am not a javascript expert, is there something I need to do apart from cutting and pasting the code into an html document? Best, Jon.

Coba mulai dari line 37 dibuat satu baris, jangan ada ‘white space':
[progressWindow.document.write(“”);] script ini dibuat satu baris.

Kalau ada error 404/file not found coba file csv yg akan di parsing di simpan satu directory/satu folder dengan file yg berisi script pada postingan ini.

Your code runs perfectly in IE8 but not in Mozilla Firefox.This is because ActiveXObject is not supported in Firefox.Do you have any workaround to run in Firefox too?Thanks.

I am using this to crunch some numbers… not for anything in production. So, I will be using it in Chrome… and it works. I didn’t use the entire thing. I am just using the parseLineCSV function. But, it works like gravy with the suggested changes. I love it! Thanks for putting this together. I don’t quite understand the string parsing theory that you are using, nor do i completely understand the regex. However, it is working and doing exactly what I need it to do. Thanks!

I started of with your script and Igor’s fix, thanks! However, I needed more advanced quoting so I wrote my own thing that duplicates the behavior of ruby’s standard csv parser as far as my test cases go (I use this in the html version of csv2vcard I’m writing):

function parseCsv(txt) {
var ret = [];
var value = “”;
var line = [];
var mode = “std”;
for(var i = 0; i < txt.length; i++) {
switch(mode) {
case "std":
switch(txt[i]) {
case "'":
case '"':
mode = txt[i];
continue;
case ",":
line.push(value);
value = "";
continue;
case "\n":
case "\r":
line.push(value);
value = "";
ret.push(line);
line = [];
continue;
default:
value += txt[i];
continue;
}
case "'":
case '"':
if(txt[i] == mode) {
if(txt[i + 1] == txt[i]) {
value += txt[i];
i += 1;
continue;
}
mode = "std";
continue;
}
value += txt[i];
}
}
if(i) {
line.push(value);
ret.push(line);
}
return ret;
}

i have a project for ftp host without sql or php server
so my alternative is for js and other type of database
well, my idea is to build a json or jquery engine that execute a database texto zipped

ex
[database.zip]
-table1.csv
-table2.csv
-table3.csv
-table4.csv

query like sql
the javascript read content of zip file
query tables (only for read)
presents the result
passw zip file in md5

i think this is possible but need some help

most women will experience menopause without long-term problems.
Since cessation of the menstrual stage has something to do with hormones and hormones have connections with the food we eat, the end should justify the
